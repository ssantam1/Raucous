# Ruckus Switch Serial Setup Script
This script allows for defining a list of commands to be run on a Ruckus Switch over serial.

### How?
- Connect to your switch over serial
- Determine COM port being used
- Input the port number at runtime
- The commands defined in the config.py will then be quickly sent to the switch

### Why?
Because now anybody can.
